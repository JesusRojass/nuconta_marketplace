# NuConta Marketplace ðŸ›’

NuConta Marketplace is the code challenge that was assigned to me in this interview process by NuBank.

The goal was to:
- fetch the Customer data
  - Stuff like their name and balance
- Offers they had including the products
  - Image, name, price, description
- Attempt to purchase and parse it's response
  - Update the balance when something is purchased
  - Parse if I got a Successful purchase or errors such as no money or promotion expired
